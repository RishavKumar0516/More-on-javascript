    <h2>Synchronous</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Any computation we do requires processor for our javascript engine to get the job done.</li>
        <li>Many request interact with things outside of the processor. For example, they may communicate over a network or request data from the storage disk.</li>
        <li>This is lot slower then getting it from memory.</li>
        <li>We don't want our processor to sit idlewhen such things happening.</li>
        <li><span>Now lets understand Synchronous these with real time example:-
            <br>
            let there is a single men, have to do many 5 work. he start doing each work individually and takes 30 minutes for doing each work. so total he takes 2hrs and 30 minutes for doing all work. these is Synchronous
        </span></li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Asynchronous</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>but if same work is done by 5 pepole then it takes only 30 minutes to do all work. And these is known as Asynchronous</li>
       <li>Asynchronous models allow multipe things to happen at the same time. but in synchronous programming model, things happen one at a time.</li>
       <li>When you call a function that perform a long action, it return only when the action has finished, so that it can return the result.</li>
       <li>these stop your program for the time the action takes.
        Asynchronous calls the every function and return the result when action is finished.</li>
    </ul>
